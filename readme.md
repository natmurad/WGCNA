# WGCNA Analysis

#### Author: Nat√°lia Faraj Murad

This script creates a Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network from expression data and group the most similar genes in cluster.
It is based on the tutorial available in [WGCNA page](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/index.html).

It was adapted to my dataset and goals.

### File Description

expressiondataEx.csv - example table with expression values for 5000 genes in 30 situations.

phenoTrait.csv - example table containing phenotypic measures for 5 traits

WGCNATut.R - script in R to perform the WGCNA Analysis. Basically the script of WGCNA page but adapted to my data

WGCNATutorial.html - document explaining how to do the analysis
